### Hello there! 👋

I am Madalena and I am a software developer currently based in Paris, France 🇫🇷🍷🥖. I have over six years of experience in web development, having worked with several programming languages and frameworks such as React (well, not a framework 😜), Java, C++, Angular, Python, Javascript, Typescript...
I worked as a Lead Developer at DNA Script, a french biotech startup where I developed user friendly web applications to ease the scientists day-to-day life. Before I worked as an IT consultant 👩‍💻 as a full stack developer for clients such as Amadeus, Bombardier/Alstom and Merck. 
I am also interested in UI/UX design 🎨, as my goal is to create user-friendly, responsive and accessible applications, to make life easier through technology.
