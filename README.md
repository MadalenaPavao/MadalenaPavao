### Hi there! 👋
I’m Madalena, a software developer 👩‍💻 with a background in biomedical sciences and bioinformatics and a strong interest in the health sector.

I have over six years of experience in web development, working with various programming languages and frameworks such as Vue, React (well, not a framework 😜), Java, C++, Angular, Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript.

Currently, I work as a full-stack developer at Pacmed, where I develop AI-based applications for ICU decision support, combining my passion for technology with my interest in healthcare.

Previously, I was a Lead Developer at DNA Script, a French biotech startup, where I contributed to innovative solutions in the biotech space. Before that, I worked as an IT consultant, specializing in front-end and full-stack development for clients such as Amadeus, Bombardier/Alstom, and Merck.

Beyond software development, I have academic experience in data analysis and data science using Python and R, which allows me to work at the intersection of health, AI, and data-driven applications.

In my applications, I focus heavily on UI/UX and design 🎨, striving to create user-friendly, responsive, and accessible solutions that improve people’s lives through technology.

Let’s connect and explore opportunities to make a meaningful impact together! 🚀
