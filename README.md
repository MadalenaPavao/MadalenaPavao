### Hello there! 👋

I am Madalena and I am a software developer based in Nice, France 🇫🇷🍷🥖. I work as an IT consultant 👩‍💻 and I have spent the last two years working as a full stack developer for clients such as Amadeus, Bombardier/Alstom and Merck. I have worked with several programming languages and frameworks such as C++, Angular, Python, Javascript, Typescript and React (well, not a framework 😜). I am also interested in UI/UX design 🎨, as my goal is to create user-friendly, responsive and accessible applications, and I am working every day to fullfil that goal.
