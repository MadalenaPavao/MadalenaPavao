### Hello there! 👋

I am Madalena and I am a software developer 👩‍💻. I have over six years of experience in web development, having worked with several programming languages and frameworks such as React (well, not a framework 😜), Java, C++, Angular, Python, Javascript, Typescript...

I worked in several different companies and environments, namely as a Lead Developer at DNA Script, a french biotech startup, and before that as an IT consultant as a front-end and full-stack developer for clients such as Amadeus, Bombardier/Alstom and Merck. I also have academic experience in data analysis and data science in Python and R.

In my applications I am very focused in UI/UX and design 🎨, as my goal is to create user-friendly, responsive and accessible applications, to make everyone's life easier through technology.
